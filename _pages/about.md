I am a 3rd year graduate student working on structure-based machine learning methods for drug discovery.
My work has largely been done as a part of the [AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) AViDD Center](https://asapdiscovery.org/), where I've gained exposure to working as part of a drug discovery team pursuing antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses with pandemic-causing potential.
I have experience with computational chemistry techniques, including molecular modeling and docking.
I am also well-versed in commonly used machine learning packages such as PyTorch and DGL, and have used these to build and train graph neural networks for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity from an input structure.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
