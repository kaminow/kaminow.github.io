	abstract = {Molecular mechanics (MM) potentials have long been a workhorse of computational chemistry. Leveraging accuracy and speed, these functional forms find use in a wide variety of applications in biomolecular modeling and drug discovery, from rapid virtual screening to detailed free energy calculations. Traditionally, MM potentials have relied on human-curated, inflexible, and poorly extensible discrete chemical perception rules (atom types) for applying parameters to small molecules or biopolymers, making it difficult to optimize both types and parameters to fit quantum chemical or physical property data. Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses graph neural networks to perceive chemical environments, producing continuous atom embeddings from which valence and nonbonded parameters can be predicted using invariance-preserving layers. Since all stages are built from smooth neural functions, the entire process—spanning chemical perception to parameter assignment—is modular and end-to-end differentiable with respect to model parameters, allowing new force fields to be easily constructed, extended, and applied to arbitrary molecules. We show that this approach is not only sufficiently expressive to reproduce legacy atom types, but that it can learn to accurately reproduce and extend existing molecular mechanics force fields. Trained with arbitrary loss functions, it can construct entirely new force fields self-consistently applicable to both biopolymers and small molecules directly from quantum chemical calculations, with superior fidelity than traditional atom or parameter typing schemes. When adapted to simultaneously fit partial charge models, espaloma delivers high-quality partial atomic charges orders of magnitude faster than current best-practices with low inaccuracy. When trained on the same quantum chemical small molecule dataset used to parameterize the Open Force Field (“Parsley”) openff-1.2.0 small molecule force field augmented with a peptide dataset, the resulting espaloma model shows superior accuracy vis-á-vis experiments in computing relative alchemical free energy calculations for a popular benchmark. This approach is implemented in the free and open source package espaloma, available at https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma.},

	abstract = {The Human Reference Genome serves as the foundation for modern genomic analyses. However, in its present form, it does not adequately represent the vast genetic diversity of the human population. In this study, we explored the consensus genome as a potential successor of the current reference genome and assessed its effect on the accuracy of RNA-seq read alignment. To find the best haploid genome representation, we constructed consensus genomes at the pan-human, superpopulation, and population levels, using variant information from The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. Using personal haploid genomes as the ground truth, we compared mapping errors for real RNA-seq reads aligned to the consensus genomes versus the reference genome. For reads overlapping homozygous variants, we found that the mapping error decreased by a factor of approximately two to three when the reference was replaced with the pan-human consensus genome. We also found that using more population-specific consensuses resulted in little to no increase over using the pan-human consensus, suggesting a limit in the utility of incorporating a more specific genomic variation. Replacing the reference with consensus genomes impacts functional analyses, such as differential expressions of isoforms, genes, and splice junctions.},

	abstract = {Computational prediction of binding between neoantigen peptides and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins can be used to predict patient response to cancer immunotherapy. Current neoantigen predictors focus on in silico estimation of MHC binding affinity and are limited by low predictive value for actual peptide presentation, inadequate support for rare MHC alleles, and poor scalability to high-throughput data sets. To address these limitations, we developed MHCnuggets, a deep neural network method that predicts peptide–MHC binding. MHCnuggets can predict binding for common or rare alleles of MHC class I or II with a single neural network architecture. Using a long short-term memory network (LSTM), MHCnuggets accepts peptides of variable length and is faster than other methods. When compared with methods that integrate binding affinity and MHC-bound peptide (HLAp) data from mass spectrometry, MHCnuggets yields a 4-fold increase in positive predictive value on independent HLAp data. We applied MHCnuggets to 26 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, processing 26.3 million allele–peptide comparisons in under 2.3 hours, yielding 101,326 unique predicted immunogenic missense mutations (IMM). Predicted IMM hotspots occurred in 38 genes, including 24 driver genes. Predicted IMM load was significantly associated with increased immune cell infiltration (P \&lt; 2 × 10−16), including CD8+ T cells. Only 0.16\% of predicted IMMs were observed in more than 2 patients, with 61.7\% of these derived from driver mutations. Thus, we describe a method for neoantigen prediction and its performance characteristics and demonstrate its utility in data sets representing multiple human cancers.},

	abstract = {We present STARsolo, a comprehensive turnkey solution for quantifying gene expression in single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq data, built into RNA-seq aligner STAR. Using simulated data that closely resembles realistic scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that STARsolo is highly accurate and significantly outperforms pseudoalignment-to-transcriptome tools. STARsolo can replicate the results of, but is considerably faster than CellRanger, currently the most widely used tool for pre-processing scRNA-seq data. In addition to uniquely mapped reads, STARsolo takes account of multi-gene reads, necessary to detect certain classes of biologically important genes. It has a flexible cell barcode processing scheme, compatible with many established scRNA-seq protocols, and extendable to emerging technologies. STARsolo can quantify transcriptomic features beyond gene expression, which we illustrate by analyzing cell-type-specific alternative splicing in the Tabula Muris project.},
